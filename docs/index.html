          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            FFP Tracker is a web application to further transparency about the
            revenues and expenses of the teams that are a part of the Turkish
            Football Federation by making teams submit their financial documents
            to the system. After submissions, the federation and its lawyers
            will have a chance to review the files, approve or deny them based
            on their conclusions. With that in mind, teams will need to work
            harder to generate more streams of revenue to stay within their
            budget limits, and spend at most as much as they earn. Some actions
            can be taken before a serious breach of regulations as the system
            will be able to forecast the teams’ future situations. All
            information will be publicly available to all, in line with the aim
            to increase transparency.

          <h3>Obtaining the source code</h3>
          <p>
            You can clone this GitHub repository to obtain the source code. All
            of the code for the application is in this repository. Once you have
            cloned the repository into your local machine, you should do the
            following:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Open the code editor of choice (VSCode is preffered as it has
              integrated terminals)
            </li>
            <li>
              Run the following command in a terminal at the root of your
              project: <code>npm i</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              Create an .env file at the root of your project. Your environment
              variables such as your <code>DB_URI</code>,
              <code>ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET</code> will be in this file. Put your
              environment variables here
            </li>
            <li>
              On both the client and server folders, run the following command:
              <code>npm i</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              After installing the necessary modules, run the following
              commands:
              <ul>
                <li>In the server folder run: <code>npm run dev</code></li>
                <li>In the client folder run: <code>npm start</code></li>

          <h3>Deployment</h3>
          <h4>Heroku Deployment</h4>
          <p>
            To deploy your application to Heroku, you can follow these steps:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Open an Heroku account</li>
            <li>Create a new application on Heroku</li>
            <li>
              Subscribe to the Heroku Student Developer to receive credits or
              pay to get credits
            </li>
            <li>Enable GitHub Integration</li>
            <li>Select GitHub deploy</li>
            <li>
              Select automatic deploy or manually deploy to the main branch.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once you are done with the development, merge your code to the
              main branch. This will automatically build and host the new
              version of your application.
            </li>
            <li>
              To add the environment variables in you .env file, follow these
              steps:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The first step is to log into your account and go to the
                  Heroku dashboard.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Choose the application for which you want to set the
                  environment variables. Once you select the application, it
                  takes you to the overview page of that project.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The next step is to go to the &quot;Settings&quot; page.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Once you are on the &quot;Settings&quot; page, scroll until
                  you see the &quot;Config Vars&quot; section. To add config
                  vars (environment variables) or modify the existing ones,
                  click on &quot;Reveal Config Vars&quot;.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If you do not have any config vars, you should see a
                      warning message.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The last step is to set the config vars. In the KEY field, you
                  specify the name of your environment variable, whereas in the
                  VALUE field, you specify its actual value. An example would be
                  storing the database URL as an environment variable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After entering both the key and the value, press
                  &quot;Add&quot; and you are done.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
